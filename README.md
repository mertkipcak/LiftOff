# Liftoff (will probably change the name later)

## Game description

This project will be a game where the player controls a rocket ship that
they can steer left to right to avoid obstacles and make money by going up.
with the money player will be able to upgrade their fuel tank, steering,
and rocket power. This app will be used by anyone who might be bored.
I am doing this project as I enjoy playing casual games that include 
progress like upgrades. 

Game will work like this. Player will start the game with no upgrades.
They will launch their rocket, and after their fuel reaches 0, they will be
brought to the upgrade shop. After the player is done buying upgrades, they
move on to the next day and launch their rocket again. goal is to reach the space in
minimum number of days.

I may add a theme and visual later on as I progress through the project.

## Note for the first phase

First phase of the game will be designed as a console game where player tries to find an 
x value for the rocket where the rocket will not hit any obstacles. I did this as it is impossible to 
implement the final real time 2D game to a console interface. However, all of the "User Stories"
are implemented for both LiftOffGame and LiftOffConsoleGame. Tests for non-console game are not
yet completed as I need to learn more about the java coordinate system.

**Also in this version of the game width of the rocket is just 1**
